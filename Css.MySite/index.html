            <h3>Beauty Secrets</h3>
            <p>She usually cleanser her face and follows it up with a toner. She then uses a small amount of moisturiser to finish off her CTM routine. She feels that since she has an oily skin, sticking to CTM routine is very important. She applies minimal makeup during the day unless its needed.</p>
